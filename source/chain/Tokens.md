## Security

### **Nal Mainnet Security Model**

Nal Mainnet is a work in progress. Constant, iterative improvement of the security mechanisms that safeguard Nal Mainnet users is a top priority for the entire Nal Labs. The Nal Labs strives to be clear and transparent about the security of Nal Mainnet.

#### **Bottom Line**

The security model of any blockchain system is only as strong as its lowest common denominator. At the moment, **it's important to understand that the security of Nal Mainnet is dependent on a [multisig(opens in a new tab)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3Da41e13c9a01a20a91B1d9603357d0d89BEBfAe)** managed jointly by the Nal Security Council.

## Terms of Service

Last Updated: **Jul 15th, 2024**

Thanks for your interest in Nal Chain, a layer-two protocol based on the Ethereum network. This Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding contract made between you and the Nal Foundation (“Nal,” “we,” or “us”) that governs your access to and use of Nal Pay, Nal Protocol, Nal Interface and Website located at [nal.network](https://www.nal.network/) (the “Site”), and Nal Testnet (collectively, the “Services”, defined below). BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE OR SITE.

Nal Chain is an open-source, layer-two protocol that operates with the Ethereum blockchain. The Nal Chain protocol includes protocol smart contracts that allow you to “bridge” (i.e., lock assets on one blockchain protocol and replicate them on another protocol) digital assets between Ethereum and/or Nal Chain (“Bridging Smart Contracts”). Neither Nal Chain nor the Bridging Smart Contracts are part of the Services. They are both operated through the use of certain open-source software that is approved by a decentralized, representative body, and a set of smart contracts that once deployed to the Nal Chain are not controlled by us (even if we contributed to their initial development). Nal does not control what third parties may build on Nal Chain, the activity of such parties, any user transacting on Nal Chain, or any data stored on Nal Chain itself, and we do not take possession, custody, or control over any virtual currency or other digital asset on Nal Chain or the Bridging Smart Contracts unless expressly stated in a written contract signed by us. You acknowledge and agree that we make no representations or warranties with respect to Nal Chain or the Bridging Smart Contracts, and that, if you use Nal Chain or the Bridging Smart Contracts, you do so at your own risk.

We offer the following Services that enable you to access and interact with Nal Chain and the Bridging Smart Contracts:

- **Nal Pay**: Nal Pay is a digital currency acceptance tool built on Nal Chain that allows merchants to accept digital currency payments. Nal Pay does not include digital currency custody services.
- **Nal Protocol**: Nal Protocol is a set of modular development components that help developers quickly deploy applications on Nal Chain.
- **Nal Testnet**: Nal Testnet is a test environment that allows you to build applications integrated with Nal Chain. You are permitted to access and use the Nal Testnet only to test and improve the experience, security, and design of Nal Chain or applications built on Nal Chain, subject to these Terms.
- **Nal Interface and Website**: The Nal Interface and Website is a web application and graphical user display operated by us and located at [nal.network](https://www.nal.network/).

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to Nal at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last Updated” date of the Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review the Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised the Terms by your continued use of the Service after the date such revised the Terms are posted.

PLEASE NOTE: THE “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION OF THE TERMS CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT REQUIRES DISPUTES TO BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND PROHIBITS CLASS ACTION CLAIMS. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND NAL ARE RESOLVED. BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.

### **DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

- Agreement to Arbitrate

This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in the Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Nal, whether arising out of or relating to the Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into the Terms, you and Nal are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.

- Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief

YOU AND NAL AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND NAL AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.

- Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution

Nal is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user’s satisfaction by emailing user support at [support@nal.network](mailto:support@nal.network). If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Nal should be sent to [*insert mail address*] (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Nal and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Nal may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Nal or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Nal is entitled.

- Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, [https://www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.

Unless Nal and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA.

- Costs of Arbitration

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.

- Confidentiality

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

- Severability

If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue to apply.

- Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement

Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms to the contrary, Nal agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Nal written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Terms).

### **GOVERNING LAW**

The Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, excluding its body of law controlling conflict of laws. You agree that the Services shall be deemed to be based solely in the British Virgin Islands, and that although the Services may be available in other jurisdictions, the availability of any Service does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the British Virgin Islands. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be conducted in accordance with the Term.

### **CORRECTIONS**

There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update the information on the Site at any time, without prior notice. Nal does not warrant that the content will be uninterrupted or error free or free of computer viruses, contaminants or other harmful items.

### **MISCELLANEOUS**

The Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site or in respect to the Service constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of the Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from the Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of the Terms or use of the Service. You agree that the Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them.
